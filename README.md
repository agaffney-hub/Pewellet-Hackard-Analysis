# Pewellet-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
 The purpose of this assignment was to go through a company's employee database to see which of the employees are of age to retire, which ones already have, as well as how many of each titled position are retiring from the company in CSV files that were created based on working with SQL and our datat provided.

## Results:
- The majority of people retiring out of the company are senior engineers at Pewellet-Hackard.

- There is a large number of retirees coming up at a total of 72,458 pending.
- Just based off of a scrolling observation, most of these employees ready to retire have been with the company long-term: since the mid to late 1990's.

## Summary: 
There are a tentative 72,458 opening roles that will need to be filled by the time the last person of this group retires, however there are only 1,941 individuals that can mentor. Even if we space out these mentorships into wide groups with 5 people each, there isnt enough variance between the types of departments eligible to mentor and being able to have the time to mentor as many as 10 people at once, because that is realistically what each person would have to take on in order to make up for the upcoming "silver wave" of retirees coming through, as well as to prepare for replacing their own roles, as all of the mentors were born in 1965 and the youngest eligible retiree was born in 1955. This is a wide age range, but to be able to prepare better for later retiring waves, this would be the best solution.
